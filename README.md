## Heads up

Make sure all classes/enums/interfaces whatever have `namespace Projeto_imdb_analyser` exactly. Making a class in a folder adds the folder name next to the namespace(atleast in vscode) and that messes up visibility.

EldirishInquisition is RafaelCS-Aula but logged in on his personal account in his pc. this mistake should only happen in the first commit.

The current base example for implementation of the search stuff is possibly overcomplicated (making a genre list and then just passing it without doing anything to it). I'm thinking this way helps with organisation with the design pattern I think it's best we use here (Facade) but we'll have to see how that works out when we have the program and idea more fleshed out.
